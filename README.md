# Tiling assistant for GNOME

An extension which adds a Windows-like snap assist to GNOME. It's intended to only work with GNOME's 2 column tiling design.

## Usage

When a window is tiled, a Dash containing icons for all non-tiled windows from the current workspace will open. The Dash will be centered on the free (/unoccupied) screen space. 
Activating an icon will tile the corresponding window to fill the free space.
